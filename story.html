        <p>Leila was filled with excitement as she boarded the bus with her mother for their first travel destination together. As the bus started moving, Leila gazed out the window, soaking in the sights of the bustling city. She noticed something curious: the travel time from one bus stop to another was always a multiple of 7 minutes.
            <br><br>"Mom, why does it take exactly 7, 14, or 21 minutes to get to the next stop?" Leila asked, intrigued.
            <br><br>Her mother smiled, seeing an opportunity to teach her about factors and multiples.

    Her mother smiled warmly at Leila's curiosity and said, "Sweetheart, the bus schedule is designed so that the travel times are multiples of 7 minutes. This helps everyone plan their trips more easily, making sure we arrive on time." Leila nodded, understanding how factors and multiples play a role in everyday routines, feeling more connected to the journey as she watched the cityscape pass by from the bus window.
